# Publish your copilot

Now that you have a working copilot, you can publish it for people to use. The
available channels through which you can deliver your copilot depend on the type
of authentication you want to use to restrict access to it. In this case, youâ€™ll
enable access for anyone and then publish the copilot for use in a demo web
page.

1.  In the navigation pane on the left, expand **Settings** and select
    **Security**.

2.  On the **Security** page, select **Authentication**. Then select the option
    for **No authentication** and save the changes to the configuration
    (confirming that you want to enable access to the copilot for anyone).

3.  Close the **Authentication** pane. Then, in the navigation pane on the left,
    select **Publish**.

4.  On the **Publish** page, select **Publish**, and publish your copilot.
    Publishing will take a minute or so.

5.  After your copilot has been published, in the navigation pane on the left,
    in the **Settings** section, select **Channels**.

6.  Review the list of channels through which you can deliver your copilot, and
    then select **Demo website**. This is an appropriate channel for users to
    test your copilot.

7.  In the **Demo website** pane, enter the following settings:

    -   **Welcome message**: `Ask me about Copilot Studio and Power Platform.`

    -   **Conversation starters**:
      ```
        "Hello"

        "How can I get started with Copilot Studio?"

        "Tell me about Power Platform"
      ```
      
8.  Select **Save** to save the settings, and then copy the link to your copilot
    demo website to the clipboard.

9.  In a new browser tab, navigate to the URL you copied to open the demo
    website, which should look similar to this:

    ![Screenshot of the demo website for a copilot](media/publish-copilot/demo-website.png)

10. Enter the message `What is Copilot Studio?` and view the response, which
    should be based on the topic you created.

11. Enter the message `What is Power Platform?` and view the response, which
    should be generated by AI based on the Power Platform website.

12. Try a few more questions and view the responses from your copilot. It will
    have limited functionality, but should be able to provide relevant answers
    to questions about using Copilot Studio or Power Platform.
