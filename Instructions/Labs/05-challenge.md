# Challenge

Now that you’ve seen how to use Copilot Studio to create a simple copilot, it’s
time to apply what you’ve learned on your own. Try creating a new copilot that
answers questions about Microsoft training and credentials.

-   The copilot can use any language you prefer.

-   Questions about training should be answered with a message instructing the
    user to visit `https://learn.microsoft.com/training/`

-   Questions about credentials or certification should result in AI-generated
    answers based on the contents of the
    `https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/` website (or the version of
    that website in your preferred language at
    `https://learn.microsoft.com/\<locale-code\>/credentials/`).

-   The copilot should be published so that users can test it in a demo website.
